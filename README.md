# Draggable UI
A draggable button written entirely in SwiftUI.
- Long press the button to unlock dragging.
- When dragging is unlocked a boundary box is displayed to show where the button can be dropped.
- Drag the button anywhere in the boundary box.
- Button snaps to the left and right edges.
- Dragging the button outside the boundary box snaps it to the nearest point inside the boundary box.
- The bottom corners of the boundary box are weighted. Dragging the button near the corner snaps to that corner.
